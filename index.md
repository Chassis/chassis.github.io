## Prerequisites

Before using Chassis, this is how your system should be set up:

* Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)
* Install vagrant-hostsupdater to access via `vagrant.local`:

		vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

  **Note for Windows users:** You'll need to set
  `C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` to be writable by your user. Simply
  head to the properties and add your user with full control under security.

  Alternatively, add `vagrant.local` to your hosts file with `192.168.33.10` as
  the IP address.

## Using

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone --recursive git@github.com:sennza/Chassis.git myproject
# If you forget --recursive:
# git submodule update --init

cd myproject

# Clone the content/ directory!
# git clone git@github.com:sennza/myproject.git content

# Use https://github.com/sennza/wp-content as a base, and follow the
# instructions there.

# Boot up a VM
vagrant up
```

Make sure you copy `local-config-sample.php` to `local-config.php`

## Working with the VM

```bash
# Start the VM
vagrant up

# SSH in to the VM
vagrant ssh

# Reprovisioning (e.g. after updating this repository)
vagrant provision

# Reprovisioning without a full apt-get update
vagrant provision --provision-with puppet

# Suspending (sleeping) the VM
# Note that this doesn't remove the hosts entry
vagrant suspend

# Halting (shutting down) the VM
vagrant halt

# Destroying the VM (if your VM is completely broken)
vagrant destroy
```

## Configuration
Chassis contains a flexible configuration setup, allowing you flexibility in
overriding the defaults. Chassis follows the following loading procedure:

* `content/config.local.yaml` (project-specific overrides)
* `content/config.yaml` (project-specific defaults)
* `config.local.yaml` (global overrides)
* `config.yaml` (global defaults)

### Multisite
Chassis has full support for running WordPress in multisite mode. Here's what
you need to do to enable it:

1. Add `multisite: Yes` to your `config.local.yaml` or project configuration.
2. Provision your VM!

   (Note: due to [a bug][#32], you need to destroy and recreate an
   already-provisioned VM. We're working on fixing this.)

That's it!

### Adding "Real" Domains

We've realized internally that using vagrant.local doesn't always cut it for
development, as you may need to use a different domain for testing. Thankfully
we can fake it 'til we make it by overriding the default configuration.

1. Add your hosts to your YAML configuration. We recommend using your
   project-specific configuration (`content/config.yaml`), since it's part of
   the site's configuration.

   ```yaml
   hosts:
       - vagrant.local
       - example.sennza.com.au
   ```

   (The first host in the list will be used as the machine's name. We recommend
   leaving this as `vagrant.local` for the most part.)

2. Reboot your VM (`vagrant reload`)

### MySQL Database
Your database can be configured completely via the YAML configuration. This is
where the YAML hierarchy is most useful:

* `config.yaml` contains the default (User `wordpress`, password `vagrantpassword`)
* `config.local.yaml` can contain your "real" database details. These can be
  generated by a deployment script, such as Capistrano.

## Updating

```bash
# Pull and rebase (in case you have project-specific commits)
git pull --rebase

## Update submodules (Puppet modules and WP)
git submodule update --init
```


## Update Your Submodules

Sometimes we have to change the submodules because a repository isn't being
regularly maintained. e.g. [Use Puppet Labs's apt module][issue-5].
When this happens you'll probably get confused by submodules so here are the
commands you need to run to get your submodules up to date again.

[issue-5]: https://github.com/sennza/Chassis/issues/5

```
git submodule sync
cd puppet/modules/apt
git checkout master
git pull

# Ensure your VM is up-to-date
vagrant provision
```
